# Hangman
## How to play
My game of hangman is easy to play as it requires only basic input. Users will have to type in a letter each time they would like to guess and then hit enter. The user can also guess the word by typing this out in the input and hitting enter. 
The aim of the game is to guess the word before you run out of lives. Incorrect guesses result in the user losing a life. 
When the user first loads up the game they will see the base hangman structure with stars underneath. Each star represents a letter in the word. As the user guesses these correctly the star will then be replaced by the correct guess. There is 2 outcomes to the game either the user wins or loses. If the user guesses all the letter or the word correctly they will win the game. If not they will lose and they correct word will be shown.
